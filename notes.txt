# Images, boiler plate code downloaded from:
https://github.com/reedbarger/ecommerce-react-graphql-stripe

# cd client
# npm install
# npm start

# The react app should now be up at: http://localhost:3000/

#
# MongoDB
# Create MongoDB Atlas account
# Create a free cluster (use AWS with whatever region)
# From the cluster, get the connection string
#

#
# Install strapi as: npm install -g strapi@alpha
# Create strapi server as: strapi new server
#       ? Choose your installation type Custom (manual settings)
#       ? Choose your main database: MongoDB
#       ? Database name: graphql-react-ecommerce-app-db
#       ? Host: ecommerce-app-mongodb-cluster-exmhs.mongodb.net
#       ? +srv connection: true
#       ? Port (It will be ignored if you enable +srv): 27017
#       ? Username: atlasadmin
#       ? Password: **********
#       ? Authentication database (Maybe "admin" or blank): 
#       ? Enable SSL connection: true
#
#       ⏳ Testing database connection...
#       It might take a minute, please have a coffee ☕️
#
#       The app has been connected to the database successfully!
#       🏗  Application generation:
#       ✔ Copy dashboard
#       ✔ Install plugin settings-manager.
#       ✔ Install plugin content-type-builder.
#       ✔ Install plugin content-manager.
#       ✔ Install plugin users-permissions.
#       ✔ Install plugin email.
#       ✔ Install plugin upload.
#       ✔ Link strapi dependency to the project.
#       # strapi start
#
# Initializing strapi would have created a bunch of collections in our mongodb
#   - users
#   - more metadata collections 
#   - we'll add more for our use case using strapi admin ui (which in turn will create them in mongodb)
#
# Start strapi as: cd server; strapi start
#   - Create a new user
#   - Create new "model types"
#
# GraphQL
#   - Install graphql plugin using the marketplace
#   - Play around with graphql at http://localhost:1337/graphql
